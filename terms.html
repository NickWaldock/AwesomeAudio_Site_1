    <h3>
        Digital Media Waiver
    </h3>
        <p>
            This information is intended to educate clients about the nature of digital media and also to establish legal boundaries regarding their digital data:
        </p>
    <ul class="bullet">
        <li>
            Make multiple backups of your data. Unless there are at least two copies of the data somewhere it is not safe. Three copies is preferred. This is YOUR responsibility! Backup copies of sessions in the digital realm should be made daily during the course of a session. Post-session backups can be made onto external hard drives, stored in an online data storage bank, or burned to DVD-R or CD-R.
        </li>
        <li>
            There is no certainty that a CD-R or DVD-R will hold data for the long term or that a stored hard drive will play back after sitting for any amount of time, so back up your data to newer media as time goes on. We highly recommend purchasing quality, name brand hard drives.Copyright and Royalties
        </li>
        <li>
            Until we have received full payment for the session, as producers of music we own the copyright of any sound recordings produced by us (intellectual property). Masterlink Productions will release all ownership to the artist/client once final payment has been made unless otherwise agreed. If you wish to discuss royalty splits or producer agreements please contact us.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
        Your Information
    </h3>
    <ul class="bullet">
        <li>
            Any personal information you provide to us for the purposes of making a booking will be retained securely and may be used by us to contact you in the future in relation to other studio activities. 
            We will not, without your prior consent pass your personal information to third parties. You have the right to request a copy of your personal information at any time.
        </li>
