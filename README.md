# Welcome to the Awesome Audio Website

[View the site here](https://nickwaldock.github.io/AwesomeAudio_Site_1/)

## Introduction

Awesome Audio is fictional music recording studio inspired from the dreams of a musician with a love for high quality and vintage audio recording alongside the inspirational tranquility that only the countryside can bring. Awesome Audio offers all this for audio recording session free from the distractions of busy city music scenes.

Thank you for taking the time to browse this site which represents my first forray into the world of coding! 

## Overview & Aims

As a high-end audio recording studio, Awesome Audio offers musicians a range of recording techniques blending the convenience of digital recording with the often sought-out warmth of vintage analogue equipment. Musicians and artists today are often caught between the decision of cost and convenience vs quality when it comes to producing a record. City studios are often expensive, small, and usually specialise in a certain recording genre. While this can be useful for smaller projects, for larger projects it can be more cost and creatively effective to retreat to a countryside studio where artists can explore multiple recording approaches free from the distractions of the fast-paced city recording dynamic.


The Awesome Audio site aims to: 

1. Establish Awesome Audio as a credible audio recording studio
2. To deliver a feel for the brand as one of sohphistication, tranquility, assurance, and style.
3. Provide an easy-to-navigate web space with ease for users to make enquiries
4. Clearly demonstrate all the initially important information a propsetive client would be insterested in and looking for when researching a recording studio, including visual gallery, recent client list, equipment lists, location, and contact details;
5. To be of responsive design and able to work on all device screen sizes

## Main Features

## Design
### Inspiration for Design
Design ideas were inspired from a number of audio recording websites, see[references](references.md). Key design ideas and important information to include was inspired by and used with permission from my good friends at [Masterlink Productions](https://www.masterlinkproductions.co.uk). Particularly the, about section, equipment list, gallery images, and terms and conditions.

Note: Artist information is fictional

### Logo and Typography
The Awesome audio logo was created in [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and uses a soft orange template image with a slightly off-white background. The font Forum makes up the main title and Monserrat for the tag line. These themes are expanded throughout the site for consistency with sans-serif as a back up font. 

Forum has an antique and classic feel reflecting the companies love for high-end vintage equipment and Montserrat to reflect simpliciity, style, and order.

### Colors and Imagery
Black solid parallel lines are used as a design feature to seperate seections and provide definition to images, this is to demonstrate stability to the design. Corners were softened to reflect the more tranquil nature of the brand. As the brand is a fictious one, images used were either from royalty-free stock images sites or from the [Masterlink Productions](www.masterlinkproductions.co.uk).

### Wireframes

[PDF Wireframe Designs](vscode-remote://nickwaldock-awesomeaudi-k036j9j144e.ws-eu54.gitpod.io/workspace/AwesomeAudio_Site_1/assets/wireframes/Site%201%20Wireframes.pdf)

Initial wireframe designs for the project were constructed after audio recording studio website research and marked up by hand. 
![](../../Screenshot%202022-07-26%20at%2016.29.33.png)
In most cases, wireframe design was adhered to, but in some cases the design was altered in the process of coding. An example of this is this [equipment section](../../Screenshot%202022-07-26%20at%2016.31.44.png), where the layout was unfeasable to display all of the relevant information in an effective and pleasing way.

## Features
- The Awesome Audio website is built with responsive design for viewports > 450vw
- Interactive elements:
  - An always visible navigation bar with in-page links and cross-site links that indicates which main page you are currently viewing.
  - Navagation text hides below 900vw and can be revealed when clicking the top left logo icon, this is to tidy up the design on smaller screens.
